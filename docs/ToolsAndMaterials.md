# Tools and materials

## Materials

These are all the materials needed to rebuild the project:

- Arduino Uno
- Arduino Ethernet Shield
- USB-B to USB-A cable (to power Arduino)
- USB internal motherboard header to USB-A (to power Arduino from inside the the PC case)
- Ethernet cable
- Micro SD card (to store website)
- Set of Dupont cables 100mm and 300mm
- 16x pin headers for dupont cables
- 3x PC817 optocoplers
- Resistors (1x 200 Ohm, 2x 330 Ohm, 1x 1 kOhm)
- PCB 30mm x 55mm
- KKSB Arduino Case for Arduino UNO and Arduino Mega
- 4x M2.5 x 14mm hexagonal nylon spacers (to screw Arduino with shield to case)

## Tools

- Soldering iron and solder
- Drill (for mounting holes on PCB)
- Thin wood saw (to shorten the nylon spacers)
- Screwdriver
